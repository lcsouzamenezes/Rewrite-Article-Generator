# Rewrite Article Generator

Article Rewriter Tool - Reword or Paraphrase Text Content, is a machine learning program that allows you to modify the sentences contained in an article while keeping the same meaning. The algorithm is made as follows: for each word it doesn't know, the program will find a list of related synonyms on the website thesaurus.com and store the list in its own database (basically, the program will be faster and faster over the time). Then the program will replace each word with the best possible synonym. Several levels of configuration are possible.

### Installation

Clone the repository in you web app folder:

```shell
git clone -b master git://github.com/Naqwa/rewrite-article.git rephrase
```
Change the directory permission for /tmp folder:

```shell
chmod -R 1777 rephrase
```

Now let's create the Database (MySQL):

```shell
mysql -uroot -p
```
```mysql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS rephrase;
```
Import the tables:
```shell
mysql -uroot -p rephrase < rephrase.sql
```

Edit the file app/Config/database.php to link the project to the database previously created:

```php
public $default = array(
		'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
		'persistent' => false,
		'host' => 'localhost',
		'login' => 'root',
		'password' => 'password',
		'database' => 'rephrase',
		'prefix' => '',
		//'encoding' => 'utf8',
	);
```
